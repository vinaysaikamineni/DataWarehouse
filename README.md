#Data Warehouse Project

This project is designed to explore and understand the concepts of data warehousing, including schema design, data ingestion, transformation, and visualization. It simulates a data warehouse environment and provides a foundation for performing analytical queries and generating insights.

##Features

	•	Schema Design: Defining fact and dimension tables to establish relationships.
	•	Data Ingestion: Jupyter notebooks for data loading and transformations.
	•	Basic Analysis: SQL scripts for data querying.
	•	Visualization: Power BI file (data_viz.pbix) for data insights.

##Project Structure

	•	Defining_Schema.sql - Schema definition for warehouse tables.
	•	data_generation.ipynb - Notebook for generating synthetic data.
	•	data_ingestion.ipynb - Data ingestion and transformation steps.
	•	basic_analysis.sql - SQL queries for basic data analysis.
	•	data_viz.pbix - Power BI file for visualization.

##Technologies Used

	•	SQL - Data manipulation and querying.
	•	Jupyter Notebook - Data processing and transformation.
	•	Power BI - Data visualization.

#Goals

To gain hands-on experience with data warehousing processes, learn schema design principles, and explore ETL and visualization techniques.
